# PFAS Fingerprinting in Massachusetts Surface Waters

This small project explores spatial patterns of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) detected in surface water across Massachusetts using public data from MassDEP.

We:
- Filtered the dataset to real samples (not QC or duplicates)
- Estimated `<MDL` (below detection) values using Â½ the MDL, only when a compound was detected elsewhere
- Averaged PFAS concentrations across sampling sites per waterbody
- Performed hierarchical clustering on PFAS fingerprints
- Visualized the spatial distribution of clusters with an interactive leaflet map
